IN PROGRESS

# 1. Download Tiled

Tiled creates tilemaps that Ranger Steve relies on to create collisions.

# 2. Use a spritesheet for tiles

- Maps are 24x24 tiles
- The smaller the faster it will run, don't be afraid to push it
- If there is a `background` layer or something just make sure I have the assets to load it

Example source spritesheet:

# 3. Create a `tiles` and `collision` layer

Don't worry about editing the collision layer I can do that.

If you want to map the collision layer too here's the sprite to help you.
